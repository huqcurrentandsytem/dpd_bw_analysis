This project provides analysis of bandwidth requirements for digital
predistiortion.

It is provided as appendix to our conference paper: On Digital
Predistortion Bandwidth Requirements written by Jan Kral and Tomas
Gotthans at Department of Radioelectronics, Brno University of
Technology.

Results provided in the paper are stored in: matlab/o1_results.mat

matlab/o1_plot_results.m - plots these results

matlab/o1_run_analysis.m - gives the stored results for direct path
and feedback bandwidth sweeps
